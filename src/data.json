                "Text": "Brief Introduction to Isolation forests DEEP They are similar to random forest in structure It performs random splits at each node instead of most informative split as used in random forest. Its basic principle is that outliers are very different from the rest of the data in terms of their features and hence Outliers are easy to isolate. easier to isolate By above assumption people have found out that they get classified at a very initial stage in the tree and so the length from the root node to its leaf node is considered to separate them. Inliers are harder to isolate Strictly Confidential Slide: 2",

It illustrates how a patient's symptoms are evaluated, leading to a diagnosis, which in turn informs the appropriate procedure and medication for treatment. The flowchart also includes a section labeled \"Signs/Symptoms,\" indicating that this is where the patient's reported issues enter the process. The image shows a flowchart with various medical-related elements and processes. The image shows a webpage from a medical dictionary with various options and information related to medical terms. The image displays a user interface for an application called 'textsense'. It seems to be a medical or health-related tool that provides various functions such as signing, symptom analysis, disease identification, and procedure information. The interface includes buttons for different actions like \"SIGN\", \"SYMPTOM\", \"ANATOMICAL SITE\", \"DISEASE\", and \"PROCEDURE\". There's also a section labeled \"SIGN SYMPTOM\" with a list of symptoms and their corresponding anatomical sites. Additionally, there is a \"RESULT\" section, though its content isn't visible in the image.",

The image contains a series of visual representations related to the concept of \"Albedo.\" The image displays a series of four images arranged in two rows. Each row contains two images, with the leftmost image being an \"Input Image,\" and the rightmost image being either \"Albedo,\" \"Normal,\" \"Roughness,\" or \"Relighted.\" The Input Images appear to be close-up views of textured surfaces, possibly materials or textures. The image is a composite of various visual representations of a surface, possibly a material or texture. It includes an \"Input Image,\" which seems to be the original or base image, and different processed versions of it: \"Albedo\" (which typically refers to the diffuse reflection component of the light from the surface), \"Normal\" (which might indicate the surface normal vector), \"Roughness\" (possibly representing the surface roughness or texture), and \"Relighted Image\" (suggesting an image where the lighting has been altered).",

The server then trains the network for rest of the layers. This completes the forward propagation. Server then generates the gradients for the final layer and back-propagates the error until the cut layer. The gradient is then passed over to the client. The rest of the back-propagation is completed by client. This is continued till the network is trained.. 2 - Client-side communication costs are significantly reduced as transmitted data is restricted to first few layers of the SplitNN prior to split. 3 - It requires a relatively larger communication bandwidth when training over a small number of clients 4 - It's has no peeking properties..

Monone > Monone consists of: Sensors, Edge device, Cloud infrastructure > Use-case: Detecting abnormal sounds > Seems like these would be unsupervised, anomaly detection models at the back-end Equilips > Sensors, Edge device, Cloud is optional > Discriminative learning models at the back-end > Equilips will be expected to perform more accurately if we have failure data Synergy > Outlier detection usually will have lot of false positives. Discriminative learning can be used to reduce false positives > Modern Deep learning methodology using autoencoders, generative methods can be helpful for both Monone and Equilips > Monone can be used in the beginning when we don't have failure data. Once we have the data Equilips signal can be incorporated and ensemble We would be happy to test Monone in our partner factories in India Asquared loT",

In legal domain, similar case laws can be grouped together, which are having a similar context. This can be helpful for organizing documents and analyzing similar cases. Current system: 1. Considers entire document (case) for clustering irrespective of important fields (domain specific). 2. Works based on word frequency. Doesn't consider semantic meaning.. Improvements for Legal Domain 3.  Weightage can be provided to different fields for better results based on user's requirement such as sections, articles, judges etc E.g : For a query = 'kidnapping' with high weightage to \"type of crime\" field will result into something like below types clusters: Basic Kidnapping, High Net Worth Individual Kidnapping, Tiger Kidnapping, Express Kidnapping, Virtual Kidnapping, Political Kidnapping, Bride Kidnapping. 4.  Semantic models can be used to consider polysemy words(words with different meaning in different contexts). Same features can be used to create semantic clusters. 5. Legal sections such as laws, sections, acts, indian penal code's description can be used to improvise the clustering results. 3",

Triple Extraction We want to extract subject, predicate and object, that we call \"triple\", in sentence Our target document for demo is contract, but our business target is not only contract, we need to consider more commonly methods that be able to adapt for various documents in Japanese and English.. 1. Implement of state-of-the-art openlE method We want to implement of \"Graphene\"[Cetto et al. 2018lwith Python, that is an openlE method for complex linguistic structure. We also want to use the method in Japanese, so we expect to use KNp, that is a Japanese on language. 2. Implement and evaluation of another method. We want to evaluate of various triple extraction methods. For example, Bert is powerful methods for improving various NLP algorithm..

Each graph is labeled with the number of iterations of backpropagation, indicating that they likely represent different trials or settings in the model training process. The image displays four graphs each representing the accuracy of generative iterations over 20 iterations of backpropagation. Each graph is labeled with '10 iterations of backpropagation' or '80 iterations of backpropagation' and 'Generative iterations'. The x-axis represents the generative iterations, while the y-axis represents accuracy. The lines within the graphs indicate the trend of accuracy over the generative iterations. The image shows graphs with data points and lines, likely representing some form of iterative process or experiment over multiple iterations. The graphs seem to be from a scientific study or a machine learning model evaluation. The image contains four graphs representing the accuracy of backpropagation over generations. Each graph has a different number of iterations: 100, 200, 400, and 800. The lines in the graphs indicate the trend of accuracy as the number of iterations increases.",

The page seems to be designed to help generate ICD Codes for specific medical conditions. The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage related to \"ICD Coding.\" It contains a section titled \"ICD Codes Generator\" and mentions the generation of ICD Codes with an Automated Technology Application. The text suggests that the generator is used for coding medical conditions, such as cardiorenal arrest with specific details about the condition's clinical presentation. There's also a mention of a form or input field labeled \"Submit,\" which likely allows users to enter data or submit information related to the ICD coding process. The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage or application related to ICD Coding. The main focus is on a section titled \"ICD CODE Table,\" which seems to list various International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes along with their corresponding descriptions. The table includes codes such as A419, R578, N179, and several others, each associated with different medical conditions like \"Sepsis, unspecified organism\" and \"Other cardiomyopathies.\" Additionally, there's a navigation option labeled \"Go Back\" at the bottom right corner. The image displays a webpage with a section titled \"ICD Coding\". It contains a table with two columns. The first column is labeled \"ICD Code\" and lists various codes such as A419, R578, N179, I469, I214, I509, L03119, I428, and E46. The second column is labeled \"Related Disease\" and provides corresponding descriptions for each code. For instance, the code A419 is associated with \"Sepsis, unspecified organism\", and R578 with \"Other shock\". The table seems to be part of a medical or health-related coding system, possibly used for billing or statistical purposes. There's also a navigation option labeled \"Go Back\" at the bottom right corner of the image.",

We decided to make a reservation online,which was quick and easy with instant confirmation.It was nice to be able to view the table layout and select our own online. The location is reservations positive spectacular with stunning views of the harbour and Opera House.It truly was amazing.Despite this,however, the restaurant was only about 25% full and so the atmosphere was a bit flat. Perhaps this was to our benefit as we received top class service from our waiter, Brandon, who was not only friendly and funny but extremely knowledgeable when it came to food and wine value positive pairings.Speaking of wine, the list was extensive-we loved it- and it took us what seemed like an hour to eventually decide on a loca/ Shiraz.Now on to the most important aspect, the food. Our seafood starters were delicious, as were out fillet steak mains. The one and only real desserts negative disappointment was the dessert which was served with no real imagination and looked like it had been purchased yesterday at the local grocery store.All in all, my favourite Sydney restaurant so far. So many positives and really good value too.Highly recommend location positive otripadvisor yelp amazon facebook. twitter ambience neutral Create Document Analyze Aspect-.. staff positive drinks positive AL 24",

Fine tuning the Al model to improve performance as needed Demonstration of the Al model in off-line video analysis Conversion of Al model into stand-alone real-time code  Porting the Al model on edge device. Phase 2: Larger Scale Deployment. Deployment into entire work area as per customer requirement .Defining specific activity that has to be detected Enhancement of Al model accuracy by periodic model upgrades",

This will be training data . One week of normal video data collection for testing data Labeling and annotation on the video data :We need one week of video data to start Al model training : Step 2: Model Building and Fine-Tuning .We build the deep learning model on the first set of data 2 member AlgoAnalytics team will visit the customer site to test this model on new data .Fine-tuning of the model to improve the accuracy on the test data from that one workstation . Demonstration of the model output to the customer as deliverable of POC .Step 3: Porting the Model on Edge Device . Choosing the right hardware and embedding the Al model Converting the Al model into stand-alone real-time model and porting on the edge device",

The names of the restaurants listed are \"Prezzo - North Audley Street,\" \"La Pizzeria Restaurant,\" \"Strada - St Katherine Docks,\" and \"Venerdi.\" Each listing includes an overall rating, a sentiment analysis, and a snippet of the review text. For instance, \"Prezzo - North Audley Street\" has an overall rating of 5 stars, with positive sentiment and a mention of good Italian food. Similarly, \"La Pizzeria Restaurant\" also has a 5-star rating with positive sentiment, highlighting a good homemade Italian food experience. The reviews are quite brief, but they suggest that the restaurants are well-regarded for their Italian cuisine. The image displays a webpage from a website named TEXTSENSE, which appears to be a restaurant review platform. The main content of the image includes sections for searching restaurants and viewing reviews. There are multiple entries for different restaurants, each with a brief description and overall rating. For example, there's an entry for \"Prezzo - North Audley Street\" with a description mentioning its simple good Italian food and a 5-star overall rating. Similarly, there are entries for \"La Pizza Restaurant,\" \"Strada - St Katherine Docks,\" \"Venardi,\" and \"La Pizza Restaurant\" again, each with their respective descriptions and ratings. Additionally, there's a search bar at the top where users can presumably input the name or location of a restaurant they're interested in finding reviews for. The image appears to be a screenshot of an article or a news piece. The main focus is on a text that discusses the NBA, its challenges, and an incident involving Philadelphia Eagles players during a game. There's also a mention of a person named LeBron James and another individual referred to as Trump. The text seems to be part of a larger discussion about sports, politics, and current events. The image appears to be a screenshot of a text-based article or blog post from the website \"TEXTSENSE.\" It discusses a sports-related incident involving Philadelphia's mayor and the NBA. The text is partially visible, and it seems to be discussing a challenge faced by an NBA player named Steph Curry in handling criticism and pressure. The content suggests a narrative about the challenges of being a high-profile athlete, possibly in the context of a game or event that has attracted significant attention and controversy.",

For example, it will turn a1024x1024x3 image into a 32x32x2048 feature map that serves as input for the next layers.. V. Region Proposal Network (RpN): Using regions defined with as many as 200K anchor boxes, the RPN scans each region and predicts whether or not an object is present. vi. Region of Interest Classification and Bounding Box: In this step the algorithm takes the regions of interest proposed by the RPN as inputs and outputs a classification (softmax) and a bounding box (regressor). vil.

Classes saw-on-cut-off vs saw-on-cut-on still needs to be worked on as the accuracies are not meeting the target.  Class 1 (saw-on-cut-off) vs class 2 (saw-on-cut-on) is still a challenge due to the. minority class problem (class 1 and class 2 are highly imbalanced). As well as. the distinction between these classes is not as crisp as that of saw-off vs saw- on, and there is an overlap.  Earlier, there was less variation in the data available, which made the model fail in certain test-cases. We improved the variation in one of the machines, M7, by using Data Augmentation. This led to 20% increase in performance. However, this technique may or may not work for the other machines. That is yet to be seen. Asquared loT",

We've also identified the sound of the hydraulic actuator which sets the job in place, before the welding occurs. Following is the spectrogram. We can see a low intensity sound which loses its intensity as well as frequency with time. This gives it a curve shape. This actuator-sound could help us identify the start of the welding process. o This part of the spectrogram is not clear in the consolidated spectrogram in the previous slide, due to the sound being very low-intensity (the spectrogram signature is very faint) Asquared loT",

Most of these healthcare centres are rightfully protective of the data and do not allow free sharing of the data across networks and national boundaries.. The power of deep learning is best utilized when the neural network is trained using a large amount of data from various sources, demographics and cohorts.. One of the ways of handling this situation while still making use of the knowledge from various sources is to use. distributed data learning.

Some of the findings from research are: - Split Learning works better in terms of communication and resource efficiency. number of clients is high(>100)  the parameters in the network is large(range of 10^8). Federated Learning works better in terms of communication and resource efficiency.  the number of clients is low(<100) the parameters in the network are in the range of 10^7. Conducted experiments on Federated Learning and Split Learning:. Compared Centralized, FL and SL performance for a classification problem using a shallow CNN architecture on MNisT data for 1 server, 2 client topology. Compared Centralized, SL performance for a classification problem using a dense CNN(DenseNet-121) on Lung Mass X- Ray data for 1 server, 2 client topology.

It learns to reconstruct back the original image after compressing it to a lower dimension. Since information is passed through a small bottleneck, the model only learns to. reconstruct normal images and any image which is not from normal distribution is not reconstructed properly.. VGG-16 pre-trained on the huge dataset of ImageNet is used to encode the information into smaller dimension.. The objective function minimized during training is the pixel-wise MsE between input and reconstructed image. Image reconstruction is improved greatly by adding a VGG perceptual Ioss along with MSE during training : along with MSE, the distance between embeddings from a VGG ImageNet pre-trained model of input and reconstructed image is minimized, i.e. the model is learns to. After training, the anomaly score for a particular image is calculated by measuring similarity between input and reconstructed image. The metric here used is ssim index. Low similarity or low SSIM index indicates high abnormality in the image..",
